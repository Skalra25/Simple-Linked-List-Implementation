# Simple-Linked-List-Implementation
Program that holds and prints a list of word. The words are placed according to the index number.  
If a linked list position is greater than the last item in the list, the item should be placed at the end.
If a linked list position is 0 or 1, it should be placed on the start of the list. Store each one in a singly linked list. All words (duplicate or otherwise) will be stored.  
Then the program will print the words in the order of the list. Starting at the head.
